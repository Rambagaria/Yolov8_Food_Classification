# Yolov8_Food_Classification

Aim of the Project
This project aims to develop a two-stage intelligent system designed to revolutionize how users interact with recipes and meal planning.

Accurate Ingredient Detection: The system will precisely identify multiple individual ingredients present in food images using advanced deep learning techniques.

Contextual Recipe Recommendation: Leveraging the detected ingredients, the system will recommend recipes that are contextually relevant and easily accessible from comprehensive recipe databases.

Problem Statement
Current food image analysis tools primarily focus on dish-level recognition, meaning they can tell you "this is pizza" but not "this pizza has pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives." This lacks the granular detail needed for practical cooking applications. Simultaneously, existing recipe recommendation systems are often disconnected from visual input, forcing users to manually enter ingredients they have on hand. This disconnect creates significant friction in meal planning, ingredient utilization, and culinary exploration.

Goal
Our primary goals for this project are:

To train a robust multi-label classifier capable of identifying and localizing multiple distinct ingredients from a given food image.

To design an efficient recipe retrieval engine that seamlessly maps the automatically detected ingredients to relevant recipes, minimizing the need for any additional user input or components.
