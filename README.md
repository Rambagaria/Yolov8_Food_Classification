# Yolov8 Food Classification & Recipe Recommendation

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Most current food image analysis tools focus on **dish-level recognition** ‚Äî they can identify a dish as *"pizza"*, but fail to detect *"pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives"*. This lack of detailed ingredient-level information limits practical cooking applications.

At the same time, existing recipe recommendation systems are **disconnected from visual input**, requiring users to **manually input** ingredients. This disconnect introduces friction in:

- Meal planning  
- Ingredient utilization  
- Culinary exploration

## üìå Aim of the Project

This project aims to develop a two-stage intelligent system that transforms the way users interact with recipes and meal planning.

## 2 Stage Pipeline

### üîç Stage 1: Accurate Ingredient Detection  
Leverage Yolov8 to accurately identify multiple individual ingredients present in food images.

### üìñ Stage 2: Contextual Recipe Recommendation  
Utilize the detected ingredients to retrieve contextually relevant and accessible recipes from comprehensive recipe databases using TF-IDF + T5 for recipe recommendation

## üì¶ Features

- Ingredient-level recognition from images  
- Real-time or batch recipe suggestion  
- Scalable and modular pipeline  
- Potential for integration with existing meal planner apps

## Dataset

FOOD INGREDIENTS DETECTION dataset
Size: 1425 training images, 286 validation images, and 190 test images.
Type: All data is image-based, with labels in YOLO format, where each label represents a bounding box with class ID and normalized coordinates.
Distribution: The dataset is slightly imbalanced. 
The top five most common ingredients are:
Egg (203 instances)
Lemon (178)
Cucumber (164)
Onion (160)
Tomato (150)
